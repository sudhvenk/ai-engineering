You are generating synthetic but realistic recreation center brochures
to be used as ground-truth data for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

Your task is to create EXACTLY 15 brochures, each saved as a separate Markdown (.md) file,
representing recreation websites across the United States.

Brochure distribution:
- 3 Theatres
- 7 YMCA locations
- 5 Town Libraries

Each brochure represents ONE recreation website.
A website may support multiple activity categories, but must follow the constraints below.
